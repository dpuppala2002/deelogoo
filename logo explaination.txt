==>>Explanation for HTML Code::->


The code I provided is an HTML document. It has a <!DOCTYPE html> tag, which tells the browser that the document is in HTML format. It also has a <head> tag, which contains meta-information about the document, and a <body> tag, which contains the actual content of the document.

The <head> tag has two <meta> tags. The first <meta> tag has the charset attribute, which specifies the character encoding of the document. The second <meta> tag has the viewport attribute, which specifies the initial size of the document in the browser window.

The <body> tag has a <div> tag. The <div> tag is used to create a division, which is a block of content that can be styled independently. The class="rotate-45" attribute on the <div> tag tells the browser to rotate the contents of the division by 45 degrees.

The <div> tag has two <p> tags. The <p> tag is used to create a paragraph. The text "HTML & CSS" is in the first <p> tag. The class="re" attribute on the first <p> tag tells the browser to read the text. The text "design and build websites" is in the second <p> tag. The class="de" attribute on the second <p> tag tells the browser to de-emphasize the text.

Here is a more detailed explanation of each line of code:

<!DOCTYPE html>
This line tells the browser that the document is in HTML format.

<html lang="en">
This line specifies the language of the document. In this case, the language is English.

<head>
This line starts the <head> section of the document. The <head> section contains meta-information about the document, such as the character encoding and the initial size of the document in the browser window.

<meta charset="UTF-8">
This line specifies the character encoding of the document. In this case, the character encoding is UTF-8.

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
This line specifies the initial size of the document in the browser window. In this case, the document will be displayed at its natural size, regardless of the size of the browser window.

</head>
This line ends the <head> section of the document.

<body>
This line starts the <body> section of the document. The <body> section contains the actual content of the document.

<div class="rotate-45">
This line creates a <div> tag with the class name rotate-45. The class attribute is used to assign a class name to an element. Class names can be used to style elements with CSS.

<p>HTML <a class="re">&</a> CSS</p>
This line creates a <p> tag with the text "HTML & CSS". The class="re" attribute on the <p> tag tells the browser to read the text.

<p class="de">design and build websites</p>
This line creates a <p> tag with the text "design and builds websites". The class="de" attribute on the <p> tag tells the browser to de-emphasize the text.

</body>
This line ends the <body> section of the document.

</html>
This line ends the HTML document.








==>>Code Explanation for CSS::->

The code you provided is a CSS stylesheet. It contains four style rules.

The first style rule, .rotate-45, applies to any element with the class name rotate-45. It rotates the element by 45 degrees, sets its width and height to 200px, sets its margin to 50px, and sets its borders to red, blue, brown, and green. It also sets its background color to black and its font family to "Open Sans".

The second style rule, p, applies to any paragraph element. It rotates the paragraph by -45 degrees, sets its color to white, sets its padding-top to 50px, sets its font size to 20px, and sets its font weight to bold.

The third style rule, .re, applies to any element with the class name re. It sets the color of the element to red.

The fourth style rule, .de, applies to any element with the class name de. It sets the color of the element to white, sets its font size to 10px, sets its padding-top to 2px, sets its padding-left to 50px, and sets its font family to "Open Sans".

Here is a more detailed explanation of each style rule:

.rotate-45 {
    transform: rotate(45deg);
    width: 200px;
    height: 200px;
    margin: 50px;
    border-top: 19px red solid;
    border-bottom: 19px blue solid;
    border-right: 19px brown solid;
    border-left: 19px green solid;
    background-color: black;
    font-family: "Open Sans";
}
This style rule applies to any element with the class name rotate-45. It rotates the element by 45 degrees, sets its width and height to 200px, sets its margin to 50px, and sets its borders to red, blue, brown, and green. It also sets its background color to black and its font family to "Open Sans".

The transform property is used to transform the element. The value rotates (45deg) tells the browser to rotate the element by 45 degrees.

The width and height properties set the width and height of the element.

The margin property sets the margin of the element.

The border property sets the borders of the element.

The background-color property sets the background color of the element.

The font-family property sets the font family of the element.

p {
    transform: rotate(-45deg);
    color: white;
    padding-top: 50px;
    font-size: 20px;
    font-weight: bold;
}
This style rule applies to any paragraph element. It rotates the paragraph by -45 degrees, sets its color to white, sets its padding-top to 50px, sets its font size to 20px, and sets its font weight to bold.

The transform property is used to transform the element. The value rotates (-45deg) tells the browser to rotate the paragraph by -45 degrees, which is the same as rotating it 45 degrees clockwise.

The color property sets the color of the element.

The padding property sets the padding of the element.

The font-size property sets the font size of the element.

The font-weight property sets the font weight of the element.

.re {
    color: red;
}
This style rule applies to any element with the class name re. It sets the color of the element to red.

.de {
    color: white;
    font-size: 10px;
    padding-top: 2px;
    padding-left: 50px;
    font-family: "Open Sans";

}
This style rule applies to any element with the class name de. It sets the color of the element to white, sets its font size to 10px, sets its padding-top to 2px, sets its padding-left to 50px, and sets its font family to "Open Sans".
